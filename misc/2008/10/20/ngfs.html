As far as ext4 is concerned, being in the mainline was all upside, and
I believe that having in the kernel *did* accelerate its progress.  It
meant that kernel-wide API changes were applied automatically, and it
meant that kernel developers who wanted to try out ext4 could do so
quite easily.  Yes, in the past two releases I started maintaining
patchsets against a stable kernel; this was mainly to support those
users who didn't want to follow the latest git releases --- and that
was a reflection that ext4 was mature enough that there were stable
kernel users who were interested in using ext4.  I could have used the
-stable infrastructure, but ext4 was changing so rapidly that it was
easier just to maintain a full patchset.  As a matter of fact,
starting with 2.6.27, given that we'll be renaming ext4dev to ext4 in
the 2.6.28 mergeset, the plan is that we'll be submitting patches to
the -stable series.

Yes, ext4 didn't go as quickly as I would have liked, but part of the
problem was I personally didn't have enough time to review the patches
being created by the various ext4 developers, and I wasn't about to
merge patches until they were ready.  We didn't have enough senior
developers on ext4, and it took a while for some of the developers
assigned to the project to get up to speed.  (I was the most senior
developer, but I've never had time assigned by my employer to work on
ext4; it has always something I did on my own time, often late at
night (hint: check the time this mail was sent, and when the last ext4
patchset was sent out last night).  Fortunately, at this point a
number of developers like Aneesh have become comfortable with the
code, and good at writing patches that don't require major review and
changes, and the addition of engineers hired by Red Hat, such as Eric
and Val, have also helped immensely.

As far as btrfs is concerned, one of the things that you may not know
is that about a year ago (on November 12-13, 2007), a small group key
filesystem developers, that included engineers employed by HP, Oracle,
IBM, Intel, HP, and Red Hat, and whose experience included working
with a large number of filesystems: ext2, ext4, ext4, ocfs2, lustre,
btrfs, advfs, reiserfs, and xfs came together for a two day &quot;next
generation filesystem&quot; (NGFS) workshop.  At the end of the that
workshop, there was unaminous agreement (including from yours truly)
that (a) Linux needed a next generation filesystem to be competitive,
(b) Chris Mason's btrfs (with some changes/enhancements discussed
during the workshop) was the best long-term solution for NGFS, and (c)
because creating a new enterprise filesystem always takes longer than
people expect, and even then, it takes a while for enterprise users to
trust a new filesystem for their most critical data, ext4 in the next
generation of filesystems was needed as the bridge to the NGFS.

The reason why we made these recommendations was not to influence open
source developers (which is why we haven't really talked about it a
lot in venues like the LKML) but as recommendations to the management
of the above-mentioned for assigning resources to the project.  (One
of the recommendations we made was that a critical success factor was
that knowledge about the filesystem must be spread throughout multiple
vendors and distributions.)  But I think it is fair to say that btrfs
isn't just a private a project of a single Linux kernel developer, but
rather the design has been discussed and reviewed by a large number of
experienced filesystem architects.  What *is* important is that Chris
is a well-known kernel developer who is trusted to create and maintain
quality kernel code, and his employer *has* apparently given him
enough time that he can do a lot of personal, hands-on development.

Given btrfs's current status, in terms of its functionality, even its
format is not fully cast into stone yet, and given Chris's reputation
and skills as a kernel devleoper, my personal opinion is that we would
not be making a &quot;special case exception&quot; for btrfs to get it into
mainline, but rather something which makes completely good sense.
